            <h4>Answer:</h4>

              Soap is made up of fatty acids, which are amphipathic. The fatty
              acids in soap have a single charged head group (for example, a
              carboxyl group) and a long hydrocarbon tail. In water, fatty acid
              molecules tend to form micelles. The micelle, like the bilayer, is
              a compromise between the hydrophilic lipid head and the
              hydrophobic lipid tail. Lipids whose heads are far wider than
              their tails are more prone to forming micelles instead of
              bilayers.
