          Phosphoglycerides have the following components: a glycerol backbone,
          two fatty acid chains, a phosphate group, and (usually) an alcohol.
          The polar head portion of the molecule is comprised of the glycerol
          backbone and the phosphorylated alcohol (or phosphate alone). The
          fatty acid "tails" in phosphoglycerides usually have an even number of
          carbon atoms, averaging 14 to 24, with 16 and 18 being the most common
          numbers.
